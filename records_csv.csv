"April 14, 2022",Telecom & ITData Center,Data Center Fire Detection and Suppression Market - Global Outlook & Forecast 2022-2027,"The study includes In-depth Analysis and Data-driven Insights on the Global Data Center Fire Detection and Suppression Market Report
The global data center fire detection and suppression market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.20%.
Key Market Highlights:
According to the Uptime Institute, between 2016 and 2020, there were 13 instances of publicly reported data center outages caused due to fires. The cost of an outage can lead to a loss of USD 5,000-USD 7,000 per minute for an operator, highlighting the requirement for robust fire safety equipment.
Gas-based fire suppression systems, using inert gas or clean agent suppression systems, are increasingly being adopted by data center operators in server rooms, and constitute over 80% of the overall market for fire suppression systems.
Industry standards under the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA 10, NFPA 25, and NFPA 75, among others) set guidelines for data center fire detection and suppression. For instance, the NFPA 25 standard is used for the inspection, testing, and maintenance of the fire suppression system using water as a fire extinguishant.
A majority of center operators, especially hyperscale operators, are deploying Very Early Smoke Detection Apparatus (VESDA) in data centers. For instance, DataPro Moscow One data center facilities installed VESDA and HFC 227 fire extinguishants for fire suppression in the facility.
Regions such as the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America will be the major areas of opportunity for vendors supplying fire detection and suppression equipment, such as Carrier, Minimax, and SEVO Systems, among others, owing to a rapidly evolving data center market.

Excerpt
This study has been prepared to deliver an updated, independent, wide-ranging assessment of the market for pressure-sensitive labeling and product decoration applications that do not utilize a release liner - linerless labels. This technology is of particular interest, in two contexts. First, the entire value chain is continually challenged with demands to decrease costs of the finished decorated product or package. Removing the release liner in a pressure-sensitive laminate could make significant cost savings. The second context is that of sustainability.
Linerless labeling technologies are now viewed as a real opportunity by many laminate producers. Linerless labels are gaining an increasing share of the pressure-sensitive label market, and show promising growth in VIP and primary product pressure-sensitive labels. This report brings you up to speed on new developments, growth areas and the applications in which linerless labels are used.

"April 6, 2022",Advanced MaterialPlastic,"Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) & Polybutylene Terephthalate (PBT) Resins Market by PET Type, PET Application (Bottles, Films, Food Packaging), PBT Application (Electrical & Electronics, Automotive, Consumer Appliance), Region - Global Forecast -2026","The global PET resin market size was USD 28.1 billion in 2020 and is projected to reach USD 52.2 billion by 2026. It is anticipated to register a CAGR of 6.1% between 2021 and 2026. PET is the only recyclable polyester and is used in different applications compared to the other thermosetting materials. This advantage of being reusable helps the manufacturers to have a cost advantage. Recycling PET increases the consumption of PET bottles and supports the demand for PET resin. In contrast, volatility in raw material prices, such as crude oil, affects the price of ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid, influencing the price of PET resin. The increasing demand will burden the industry over the next few years.
The PBT resin market is projected to register a CAGR of 5.1%, in terms of value, between 2021 and 2026.
The global PBT resin market size was USD 3.1 billion in 2020 and is projected to reach USD 5.3 billion by 2026. It is anticipated to register a CAGR of 5.1% between 2021 and 2026. The automotive manufacturers are using PBT materials in their car production to overcome the challenges, such as reducing fuel consumption, CO2 emissions, and lightweight regulations by the European Commission. PBT is lightweight compared to steel and aluminum used in automotive cars. Therefore, it drives the demand for PBT. On the other hand, reducing halogen content in flame-retardant PBT is a key challenge because substituting a non-brominated, non-chlorinated FR chemistry usually degrades its mechanical performance. Due to strict environmental regulations, brominated flame retardants are not acceptable in Korea and China.
The PET resin market in the transparent &amp; non-transparent PET segment is expected to hold the largest share during the forecast period.
The transparent &amp; non-transparent PET segment leads the overall PET resin market. The rise in demand for PET containers, especially from the food &amp; beverage sector and the increase in demand for frozen &amp; processed food are some major factors driving the growth of the transparent &amp; non-transparent PET segment of the PET resin market.
The PET resin market in the bottles segment is expected to hold the largest share during the forecast period.
The bottles segment is expected to dominate the PET resin market. The demand from industries such as food and beverage, consumer goods, and others for packing materials is growing due to the increasing consumption of PET resin. The growing demand for lightweight and convenient packaging, increasing quality of ready-to-drink beverages &amp; flavored water, development of innovative merchandise, rising income, increasing usage in attention merchandise, and demand from personal care and pharmaceutical business can enhance the growth of the PET bottle market.
The PBT resin market in the electrical &amp; electronics segment is expected to hold the largest share during the forecast period.
The PBT resin market's growth is based on the growth of the electronics application, not the downsizing of micro-electronics. The key driver of the electrical &amp; electronics industry is socio-economic development, including the rise in disposable income, particularly in the emerging markets. The above factors will drive the PBT resin market in the Asia Pacific during the next five years. The markets in China, India, and other rapidly emerging countries are expected to witness strong growth in this segment. In contrast, developed markets such as the US, Germany, Japan, and the UK are expected to grow at slow rates during the forecast period. The demand for PBT in electronic components and assembly is expected to continue to create new growth opportunities for the market. The increased use of PBT resin in the electrical &amp; electronics segment continues to drive the PBT resin market
Asia Pacific PET &amp; PBT resins market is estimated to register the highest CAGR during the forecast period.
Asia Pacific is the manufacturing base and various leading companies are based in the Asia Pacific.

"April 6, 2022",Advanced Material,"Agricultural Micronutrients Market by Type (Zinc, Boron, Iron, Manganese, Molybdenum, and Copper), Mode of Application (Soil, Foliar, and Fertigation), Form (Chelated and Non-Chelated micronutrients), Crop Type and Region - Global Forecast to 2027","The global market for agricultural micronutrients is estimated at USD 4.3 Billion in 2022; it is projected to grow at a CAGR of 8.6% to reach USD 6.4 Billion by 2027. Factors such as an increase in micronutrient deficiency in soils, demand for high crop production and quality, increasing food security concern, and supporting government policies are projected to drive the growth of this market.
The zinc segment, is accounted for the highest share by type in the agricultural micronutrients market throughout the forecasted period
Zinc is one of the most essential micronutrients required by plants in small quantities. Sandy soil, highly leached acid soil and soils having poor organic content, show low zinc contents. The symptoms of zinc deficiency include reduced height, interveinal chlorosis, and brown spots on upper leaves. Zinc deficiency is the most common problem witnessed globally, mainly for cereals and grains, hence the demand for zinc as a micronutrient is high in the agricultural micronutrients market
The fruits &amp; vegetables segment by crop type is estimated to account for the largest market share in the global agricultural micronutrients market
Agricultural micronutrients are gaining importance among the fruits &amp; vegetable growers because of their beneficial nutritional support and at the same time, ensure better harvest and returns. Zinc deficiency commonly affects fruits such as banana, custard apple and mangoes. In citrus production, the molybdenum deficiency called as yellow spot is commonly observed. Hence proper plant nutrition is essential for the proper growth of fruits &amp; vegetables globally
Foliar application segment, by mode of application is projected to be the largest segment in the agricultural micronutrients market during the forecast period.
Foliar mode of application is widely used for the application of micronutrients, particularly iron and manganese, for various crops. It is mostly used for fruits, vegetables, and flower crops. Foliar sprays are advantageous to meet the internal demand of micronutrients during flowering when soil moisture and temperature is not favorable for growth of the crop.
For micronutrients to be applied in extremely smaller quantities, foliar sprays give an advantage of ease of application as compared to soil and fertigation. All these reasons make it the largest segment in the market
Non-chelated application segment, by form is projected to be the largest segment in the agricultural micronutrients market during the forecast period.
Non-chelated micronutrients are more widely used than chelated ones, as they are easily available and inexpensive. These micronutrients are marketed in the form of sulfates, such as zinc sulfate, iron sulfate, and copper sulfate. However, there is an increasing awareness among farmers about the benefits of chelated micronutrients, as they offer enhanced nutrient efficiency and improved absorption as compared to non-chelated micronutrients

"April 5, 2022",Advanced Material,Asphalt Companies in China,"This study focuses on China's Asphalt industry assessments and company profiles. In the two past decades, the industry has been growing at a fast pace. The dramatic expansions of the manufacturing capabilities and rising consumer consumptions in China have transformed China's society and economy. China is one of the world's major producers for industrial and consumer products. Far outpacing other economies in the world, China is the world's fastest growing market for the consumptions of goods and services. The Chinese economy maintains a high speed growth which has been stimulated by the consecutive increases of industrial output, imports &amp; exports, consumer consumption and capital investment for over two decades. Rapid consolidation between medium and large players is anticipated since the Chinese government has been encouraging industry consolidation with an effort to regulate the industry and to improve competitiveness in the world market.
Although China has enjoyed the benefits of an expanding market for production and distribution, the industry is suffering from minimal innovation and investment in R&amp;D and new product development. The sector's economies of scale have yet to be achieved. Most domestic manufacturers lack the autonomic intellectual property and financial resources to develop their own brand name products.
This new study analyzes the industry structure, capacities and output. Major producers' production locations, market shares and profiles are presented. The primary and secondary research is done in China in order to access up-to-date government regulations, market information and industry data. Data were collected from the Chinese government publications, Chinese language newspapers and magazines, industry associations, local governments' industry bureaus, industry publications, and our in-house databases.

"April 5, 2022",Advanced MaterialPlastic,Foamed Plastic Industry Forecasts - China Focus,"This study focuses on China's Foamed Plastic industry forecasts. In the two past decades, the industry has been growing at a fast pace. The dramatic expansions of the manufacturing capabilities and rising consumer consumptions in China have transformed China's society and economy. China is one of the world's major producers for industrial and consumer products. Far outpacing other economies in the world, China is the world's fastest growing market for the consumptions of goods and services. The Chinese economy maintains a high speed growth which has been stimulated by the consecutive increases of industrial output, imports &amp; exports, consumer consumption and capital investment for over two decades. Rapid consolidation between medium and large players is anticipated since the Chinese government has been encouraging industry consolidation with an effort to regulate the industry and to improve competitiveness in the world market.
Although China has enjoyed the benefits of an expanding market for production and distribution, the industry is suffering from minimal innovation and investment in R&amp;D and new product development. The sector's economies of scale have yet to be achieved. Most domestic manufacturers lack the autonomic intellectual property and financial resources to develop their own brand name products.
This new study focuses on industry trends and forecasts with historical data (2011, 2016 and 2021) and long-term forecasts through 2026 and 2031 are presented.

The dramatic expansions of the manufacturing capabilities and rising consumer consumptions in China have transformed China's society and economy. China is one of the world's major producers for industrial and consumer products. Far outpacing other economies in the world, China is the world's fastest growing market for the consumptions of goods and services.

Rapid consolidation between medium and large players is anticipated since the Chinese government has been encouraging industry consolidation with an effort to regulate the industry and to improve competitiveness in the world market.
Although China has enjoyed the benefits of an expanding market for production and distribution, the industry is suffering from minimal innovation and investment in R&amp;D and new product development. The sector's economies of scale have yet to be achieved. Most domestic manufacturers lack the autonomic intellectual property and financial resources to develop their own brand name products.
This new study analyzes the industry structure, capacities and output. Major producers' production locations, market shares and profiles are presented. The primary and secondary research is done in China in order to access up-to-date government regulations, market information and industry data.

"April 5, 2022",Advanced MaterialPlastic,Reinforced Plastics Companies in China,"This study focuses on China's Reinforced Plastics industry assessments and company profiles. In the two past decades, the industry has been growing at a fast pace. The dramatic expansions of the manufacturing capabilities and rising consumer consumptions in China have transformed China's society and economy. China is one of the world's major producers for industrial and consumer products. Far outpacing other economies in the world, China is the world's fastest growing market for the consumptions of goods and services. The Chinese economy maintains a high speed growth which has been stimulated by the consecutive increases of industrial output, imports &amp; exports, consumer consumption and capital investment for over two decades. Rapid consolidation between medium and large players is anticipated since the Chinese government has been encouraging industry consolidation with an effort to regulate the industry and to improve competitiveness in the world market.
Although China has enjoyed the benefits of an expanding market for production and distribution, the industry is suffering from minimal innovation and investment in R&amp;D and new product development. The sector's economies of scale have yet to be achieved. Most domestic manufacturers lack the autonomic intellectual property and financial resources to develop their own brand name products.
This new study analyzes the industry structure, capacities and output. Major producers' production locations, market shares and profiles are presented. The primary and secondary research is done in China in order to access up-to-date government regulations, market information and industry data. Data were collected from the Chinese government publications, Chinese language newspapers and magazines, industry associations, local governments' industry bureaus, industry publications, and our in-house databases.
Asia Market Info &amp; Dev Co. is one of the leading sources for up-to-date market information and research on the fastest-growing Chinese markets.
